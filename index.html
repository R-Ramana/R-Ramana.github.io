                    <p>
                        I am a Computer Engineer by trade. I enjoy solving complex problems and I can't stop learning new things! I am extremely interested in Internet of Things and am a huge fan of automating as many tasks as possible, making life just that much more fancier
                        and easier! in mind.

                    <p>
                        I have experience in web development, as well as UI/UX design. I have done a couple of web-dev projects and am comfortable with several frameworks and libraries. On this note, I am keen on learning more about Human-Computer Interactions and Artificial
                        Intelligence/Machine Learning.

                                        Ramana’s primary role in Khatib Medical Centre was assisting in the Adminstrative Department. He managed the Health Screening Programme (HSP) Khatib; a job that oversees 300 personnel every month. Throughout his stint in the Medical Centre, he has made
                                        innumerable improvements to the workflow and updated several protocols for the HSP. His analytical character has allowed him to troubleshoot problems early and he did so without prompting and with much enthusiasm.
                                        <br><br> Overall, Ramana has exceeded all expectations required of a Medic. He worked very closely with me and has often made many astute comments and observations in many complex medical cases. To accomplish such
                                        a task requires a high level of conscientiousness and sensibility, which happens to be one of the many strong traits that Ramana possessed. I was particularly impressed with his level of punctiliousness and he has
                                        often picked up important details that the superiors themselves have missed. In addition, he was also heavily involved with various organizations outside of the Singapore Armed Force. On top of his primary responsibilities
                                        as a Medic, he was also selected to lead the Youth delegation of Singapore Scout Association of the 9th Asia Pacific Regional Youth Forum and the 26th Asia Pacific Regional Scout Conference – a testament to his
                                        diligence and strong organization skills.
                                        <br><br> Ramana was an invaluable member to the Medical Centre and I am extremely satisfied with his performance. I am sure he will excel in his future endeavours and be an asset to any organization he chooses to
                                        join.

                                        I was the mentor for Ramana’s team during NUS Orbital 2020, an independent software engineering module offered by NUS School of Computing every year during the summer break. Over the span of 3 months, Ramana worked together with another teammate on the
                                        Knewbie web application project, which is an educational platform for primary school students to improve their knowledge by answering questions tailored to their current understanding of various Mathematics topics.
                                        <br><br> In this project, Ramana implemented the required core features successfully with minimal guidance. He demonstrated the ability to solve the issues faced during the development process by himself. Besides,
                                        Ramana has a great attention to detail especially in terms of web design, as observed from the user interfaces in the web application which was carefully crafted for the target users in mind. During my interactions
                                        with him, I observed that he possessed an inquisitive mind to ask intelligent questions with regards to the project. He was also proactive to seek advice to improve his existing knowledge on various software engineering
                                        topics.
                                        <br><br> Overall, I believe that Ramana is a suitable candidate to explore tougher opportunities, persevere through the challenges faced during the process and solve them independently. His eagerness to strive for
                                        perfection is a vital asset that will set himself apart from other peers.<br><br>

                                        I am writing you today on behalf of my student former student R Ramana, whom I was fortunate enough to support in his Quantitative Reasoning development in my course at the University Scholars Programme. <br><br>Ramana
                                        was a standout student in what I have designed to be an unstructured course of study in data science. Due to its nature, the course relies on student initiative and self-direction. Ramana has no problem setting
                                        a direction for his learning, nor taking instruction towards tasks that improve his own progress. Moreover, despite his ability to work independently, he has shown me that he too can work well in partnership with
                                        his classmates, a leader in the classroom that supports the learning of others too.<br><br> For one of his project submissions Ramana wrote a detailed reflection on an experience he had on an overseas trip, one
                                        in which he made a deep connection with locals in South Korea. Although to some, such travel experiences may just be considered for a moment as a nice memory, Ramana can internalize and incorporate experiential
                                        learning into his understanding of the world and the subjects of his study.<br><br> Finally, since I have known him Ramana has been openly looking for ways he can make a positive impact on the world. I personally
                                        have consulted with him on several volunteer outreach projects. He is a born leader, teammate, and entrepreneur. I know he will make excellent use of his time wherever he ends up. As such, I give him and you my
                                        highest recommendation to do so.<br><br>
